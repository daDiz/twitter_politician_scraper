As to what happens next:  It should be clear to Iran that President Trump will not sit idly by if our people and interests are threatened."
1213092395849572352,2020-01-03 13:38:59,"When it comes to the death of General Soleimani, there is no one to blame but himself.

He effectively signed his own death warrant by planning massive attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and throughout the Middle East."
1213083920864088067,2020-01-03 13:05:19,"We killed the most powerful man in Tehran short of the Ayatollah.  

This was not an act of revenge for what he had done in the past.  

This was a preemptive, defensive strike planned to take out the organizer of attacks yet to come."

1212937168039108613,2020-01-03 03:22:10,To the Iranian government:  If you want to stay in the oil business leave America and our allies alone and stop being the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.
1212937166759825409,2020-01-03 03:22:10,"If Iran continues to attack America and our allies, they should pay the heaviest of prices, which includes the destruction of their oil refineries."
1212937164440375298,2020-01-03 03:22:09,This action by President Trump and our military was in direct response to Iranian aggression orchestrated by General Soleimani and his proxies.

1212933798188503046,2020-01-03 03:08:47,Wow - the price of killing and injuring Americans has just gone up drastically. Major blow to Iranian regime that has American blood on its hands. Soleimani was one of the most ruthless and vicious members of the Ayatollah's regime.  He had American blood on his hands.
