1225440578164445185,2020-02-06 15:26:16,"Additionally, we recommend an integrated response to cyber events.

1225440573240348672,2020-02-06 15:26:14,"The Committee found that the Obama Administration was constrained in its response by a number of factors, including the highly politicized environment, concern that public warnings would undermine confidence in the election, and a delay in definitive attribution to Russia."
1225440572065959937,2020-02-06 15:26:14,The Committee found the U.S. government was not well-postured to counter Russian election interference activity with a full range of readily-available policy options.
