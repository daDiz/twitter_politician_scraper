1243023768286527489,2020-03-26 03:55:35,We learned our lesson from past airline bailouts—no million dollar executive bonuses or stock buybacks this time. Transparency &amp; oversight are key.
1243023766915080193,2020-03-26 03:55:34,"I’m disappointed that airlines again receive taxpayer dollars from consumers, but refuse to implement even basic consumer protections. I’m going to keep fighting for the flying public, but at least thousands of airline workers will keep their jobs."
1243023765405077505,2020-03-26 03:55:34,"Tens of millions of dollars will be available to CT small businesses in days, not weeks. I’ll be working w/Gov. Lamont to bring CT every possible dollar. Glad to see major investments in affordable housing &amp; food assistance programs."
1243023763890999296,2020-03-26 03:55:34,"This bill puts cash in the hands of families &amp; workers. Through expanded unemployment compensation, workers who lose their jobs will receive full pay or close to it for 4 months. Countless Americans will get significant cash payments."
1243023762460721153,2020-03-26 03:55:33,"A medical Marshall Plan is a linchpin. Doctors are desperate for tests, masks, protective equipment, ventilators, &amp; ICU beds. Direct aid of $130 billion to hospitals &amp; other providers to bolster access to urgently needed supplies."
1243023761076555780,2020-03-26 03:55:33,"American lives are on the line. We all have preferences that were unmet, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good during this historic moment of extreme, urgent crisis."
1243023759566659584,2020-03-26 03:55:33,"Not a panacea, but powerful remedies for recovery. With the disease spreading, &amp; thousands already out of work, action is fiercely urgent."
1243023756169281536,2020-03-26 03:55:32,"This bipartisan relief package is imperfect, but imperative. It is a big &amp; bold initiative, a monumental next step, but there must be more. https://t.co/jqHQgqdDCj"

1241830660756647937,2020-03-22 20:54:36,This COVID-19 relief package puts corporate interests ahead of workers—which is why we’re working hard to improve it. Deeply inadequate support for medical needs is a key failing.
1241826240950161408,2020-03-22 20:37:02,What we don’t need is a slush fund for the President’s corporate cronies &amp; a multi-billion dollar giveaway to Trump’s hotel chain while no help is given to small businesses trying to meet payroll &amp; Americans who have bills to pay. It’s inexcusable.
1241826239347920897,2020-03-22 20:37:02,We need hospital gowns &amp; masks. We need more ventilator &amp; expanded ICU capacity. Small businesses need grants not loans. American families need financial assistance &amp; money in their pockets—today.

1240788297078714368,2020-03-19 23:52:37,"A relief package for any industry must put workers first. Instead of corporate welfare, there should be grants &amp; loan forgiveness for small businesses, which are the job creating backbone of our economy."
1240788295069638661,2020-03-19 23:52:36,The McConnell plan is a blank check bailout for the airlines without any necessary worker &amp; consumer protections. This proposal totally fails to prevent the corporate excesses &amp; abuses that followed past taxpayer bailouts.
