1247272463001686017,2020-04-06 21:18:23,Wow! Big $ GOP donor Mike Gula leaving his firm to sell medical supplies/PPE! Where is he getting the supplies &amp; how can he fill 100 million orders of masks when states can‚Äôt get them? What are his relationships? Will his PPE come from fed stockpile?
1247271191519395840,2020-04-06 21:13:19,Would Trump dare use #coronavirus as an opportunity to reward big GOP donors &amp; place people in our country in a vulnerable position b/c the PPE hasn‚Äôt been available to the states?

1247270929752895500,2020-04-06 21:12:17,Is Trump using the federal government to block the states from being able to purchase PPE or forcing them to sale to the federal stockpile?
