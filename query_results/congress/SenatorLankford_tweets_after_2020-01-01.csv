1212951641479094272,2020-01-03 04:19:41,Gen Soleimani is personally responsible for killing US military &amp; allied forces in Iraq. @realDonaldTrump sent multiple signals there would be consequences if they killed another US citizen &amp; continued his pursuit of aggression in Iraq and the Middle East.

Unfortunately, the Iranian regime has impoverished their people while pursuing brutal aggression throughout the Middle East. Their acts of terrorism have destabilized the entire Middle East."
