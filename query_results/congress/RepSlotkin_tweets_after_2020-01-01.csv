1222923860963622912,2020-01-30 16:45:43,There are currently two Congressional authorizations for the use of military force (AUMF) on the books:

POTUS must seek Congressional authorization if he intends to use protracted military force against Iran."
1222923859256659969,2020-01-30 16:45:43,"In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution (WPR) with bipartisan support. It says:

POTUS must notify Congress within 48 hrs of initiating the use of military force.

Military force must be terminated within 60 days unless POTUS receives Congressional authorization."

1222923856438054913,2020-01-30 16:45:42,The President derives authority to use military force from two sources: (1) the Constitution and (2) Congressional authorization.

1222923854223486977,2020-01-30 16:45:42,"Bottom line: these votes help start a necessary conversation on the gravest decisions we in Congress are asked to make -- whether or not to send our troops into war.
