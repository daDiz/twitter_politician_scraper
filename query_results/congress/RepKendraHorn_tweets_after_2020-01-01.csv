1218207805582331906,2020-01-17 16:25:48,Great to be at @kfor &amp; @KOCOnews this morning to talk about our Civil Rights &amp; Justice Town Hall tomorrow at Fairview Baptist Church from 1-3pm. We invite you to join us for a discussion on OKC’s proud history in the fight for civil rights &amp; talk about the work being done today. https://t.co/PsWgiclBYT
1217878952334839813,2020-01-16 18:39:03,"As we approach MLK Day, it's critical we pause to acknowledge those who fought &amp; continue to fight for justice.
Please join me this Saturday, Jan. 18 from 1-3 PM at Fairview Baptist Church for discussion about the civil rights &amp; justice issues facing our communities today. https://t.co/DlsuRwrnbQ"
1217869166167973890,2020-01-16 18:00:10,"Great news! The Senate just passed the bipartisan USMCA trade deal! Stronger trading relationships with our neighbors mean a stronger economy for OK workers, businesses, and families. Today’s win is another example of what we can accomplish when both parties work together."
1217847368600686593,2020-01-16 16:33:33,Americans hold $1.6 trillion in student debt. We still need action to reduce the cost of higher ed and we must tackle the student debt crisis. Today’s bill is a first step to help students defrauded by for-profit colleges and to hold predatory institutions accountable.
1217847364502900736,2020-01-16 16:33:32,"For too long, predatory colleges have cheated U.S. students. Now, Devos is proposing a rule making it harder for students to seek relief. Today the House took action to stop that rule from going into effect."
1217847361382293509,2020-01-16 16:33:32,Never before has there been a Secretary of Education who cares so little for our students. Betsy Devos has actively worked to block student debt relief measures for those defrauded by for-profit colleges. Today the House is taking action to protect students from Devos’ policies.
1217589636299722752,2020-01-15 23:29:25,Many harmful tariffs are still in place. It’s going to take time to recover from the trade war of the past two years. Trade decisions should be focused on providing certainty and promoting economic competitiveness not partisan politics.
1217589635251167232,2020-01-15 23:29:25,I am cautiously optimistic that the #PhaseOne trade deal represents a step forward for the OK businesses and consumers hurt by the trade war. For too long China cheated US companies with unfair practices like forced tech transfers. This is a first step towards free &amp; fair trade.
1217203323310395395,2020-01-14 21:54:21,Today I introduced legislation to rename the downtown post office as the Clara Luper Post Office. The historic sit-ins led by Luper and the NAACP Youth Council changed Oklahoma and inspired desegregation actions across the South. We must remember and celebrate our proud history. https://t.co/6BhBLeu0n9
1217131275653406721,2020-01-14 17:08:03,RT @townhallproject: @RepKendraHorn Thanks for always putting Oklahomans first!
1217128469840175104,2020-01-14 16:56:55,As the Congresswoman representing #OK5 I'm proud to be a voice for all Oklahomans. That means listening to people's concerns and taking action on issues important to our state. I'm honored to place in the top ten in the House for accessibility. Great report by @townhallproject! https://t.co/pDJQP1S6EP
1216910938881822720,2020-01-14 02:32:31,Thanks to those who braved the cold and joined us in Bethany for our town hall this weekend! A special thank you goes out to Boy Scout and Girl Scout Troops for posting our colors and leading us in the pledge of allegiance. https://t.co/CenImL06AD
1216877231986937857,2020-01-14 00:18:35,"Sexual assault and harassment have no place in our Armed Forces. Today I stood with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to demand justice for victims of assault in the military, including a victim from OK, as their case heads to the Supreme Court. https://t.co/2ZSuyCiNkq"
1216051058105049089,2020-01-11 17:35:40,Good morning! We'll see you at the town hall from 1-3 PM at the Children's Rehabilitation Center Hospital in Bethany. Park on Level 2 or above of the parking garage and enter through Entrance 2. https://t.co/0uRQ6Umw0J
1215803739073847296,2020-01-11 01:12:54,There’s a right and wrong way to keep a check on the Administration and make long-term national security decisions. Partisan politics is the wrong way. Using our constitutional authority to set clear &amp; strategic boundaries about how and when Armed Forces are used is the right way
1215803737878532096,2020-01-11 01:12:54,"I want to see both parties work together to pass an updated Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). The AUMF defines where and when Armed Forces can be used, but the last time Congress passed an AUMF was in 2002. We must update to account for current security threats."
1215803735882051586,2020-01-11 01:12:53,"As tensions with Iran escalate, my priority is protecting the long-term security of Americans. That means ensuring the ability to respond to threats while preventing a reckless war, and fulfilling Congress’s obligation to determine where Armed Forces are used."
1215803734732746754,2020-01-11 01:12:53,My vote this week on the War Powers Resolution was not a go-ahead for the President to engage in a military conflict. My vote was against a resolution more focused on partisan politics than the best interest of our national security.
1215711794540556293,2020-01-10 19:07:33,"Our state has lost a champion for equality. Please join me in mourning the loss of a fellow Oklahoman, Dustin Parker.

1215428561093517312,2020-01-10 00:22:05,"PFAS are toxic, man-made chemicals. They're often called ""forever chemicals"" because they persistent in the environment and accumulate in our bodies. PFAS are linked to cancer, impaired child development, and many other diseases. We must confront this urgent public health threat."
1215428560258772992,2020-01-10 00:22:04,More information on the Oklahoma sites which have tested positive for PFAS contamination is available here: https://t.co/nOnzfzxHso
1215428559147294721,2020-01-10 00:22:04,"Access to clean water is a basic human right. Sadly, four water sites in OKC alone have tested positive for PFAS chemicals.

1214608390724427777,2020-01-07 18:03:01,"The American public deserves to know what comes next. Looking forward, we need a plan from the President and assurance that this Administration is taking every precaution to avoid a reckless war that puts American citizens and service members in harm’s way."
1214608389394882561,2020-01-07 18:03:01,There’s no question that Soleimani was a threat to the U.S. and that he was responsible for the death of hundreds of Americans. But are Americans safer now than before Soleimani was killed? Our military decisions should be deliberate and targeted at increasing long-term security.
1214608387872350208,2020-01-07 18:03:00,"As tensions with Iran escalate, protecting the safety and security of the American people has to come first. The President must work with Congress on a strategy that manages risk to American citizens and avoids another reckless war in the Middle East."
