1220155503059390464,2020-01-23 01:25:15,"2) It’s compelling to see how many facts link to Russia—the false theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in our 2016 election; how withholding aid weakened Ukraine in its fight with Russia; and how Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Donald Trump; and"
1220155502161809414,2020-01-23 01:25:15,1) The facts aren’t really in dispute. Even the President’s lawyers haven’t challenged them so far.

We aren’t done for today just yet, but here are my thoughts:"
1220155500148482048,2020-01-23 01:25:15,"I’m keeping notes in a red notebook—kind of a stream of consciousness of quotes, observations, and things to remember. I’m starting to think about questions I want to ask."
1220155499087388674,2020-01-23 01:25:15,"Day 2, after a long night yesterday, and you can feel people settling into this new world of hours sitting on the Senate floor, listening and taking notes. And maybe a catnap or two (not naming names)."
1220017914742497283,2020-01-22 16:18:32,"And THEN, graciously allow a debate on whether witnesses should be called, even though the trial is basically over. All the while, talk about fairness and hope America doesn’t notice.

I think America is noticing."
1220017912829923328,2020-01-22 16:18:31,"Based on how things went yesterday, here’s Mitch McConnell's plan for how to hold an impeachment trial:
    
First, tell the prosecution that they can’t call any witnesses.  Not any. Tell them to argue their case and then let the jury (that’s us) ask questions."
1219780830924591105,2020-01-22 00:36:27,"3) McConnell's move to table seems designed to protect his members from a ""no"" vote on including documents and witnesses for this trial, but I bet Americans will see what's really happening here."

There is tea, coffee, and treats in the cloakroom."
1219780828080869376,2020-01-22 00:36:26,"The President's lawyers seemed to be speaking to an audience of one. On questions of whether the Senate should call for witnesses and documents, they talked about Mueller, Pelosi, and Schiff.

Sometimes it came off as a bit incoherent. They read from notes and seemed unprepared."
1219780827254611968,2020-01-22 00:36:26,"The House managers today relentlessly plowed through questions about witnesses and documents, and asked us essentially ""Why WOULDN'T you want to know this? Why WOULDN'T you want to see the documents?""

I agree."

1219409977208659969,2020-01-21 00:02:48,"Then, two day, 24-hour marathons for presenting each side. Would you want your lawyer to be required to represent you under these circumstances?

It’s outrageous and a clear sign McConnell has no intention of holding the fair trial that Americans expect."
1219409976403341312,2020-01-21 00:02:48,"Just reading proposed GOP impeachment trial rules, which are ridiculous.
