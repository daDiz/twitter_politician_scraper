1221932287463432193,2020-01-27 23:05:34,I’d like to hear more on how President Trump illegally froze aid to Ukraine and why. Not conspiracy theories and distractions. We need relevant witnesses. We need to hear from John Bolton.
1221932286490312707,2020-01-27 23:05:34,"My take on today so far:

•Ken Starr, complaining impeachment is bad.
•Pam Bondi, complaining about the appearance of a conflict of interest.
•Trump lawyers, complaining about apparent nepotism.

As hypocritical as it is irrelevant to the serious evidence before the Senate."
1221890314442543104,2020-01-27 20:18:47,"FACT CHECK: The President’s lawyer just argued that President Trump has steadfastly battled corruption. NOT TRUE.

He's tried to GUT anti-corruption aid and wants to WEAKEN a vital anti-corruption law (FCPA). Here are the FACTS: https://t.co/JPmFDJ8HZp https://t.co/xEPmyhW0My"
1221852509511258113,2020-01-27 17:48:33,Let’s not be distracted by arguments that have nothing to do with the actual LAW. The law provides no excuse for blocking John Bolton’s testimony. The Senate must not be complicit in a cover-up. /6
